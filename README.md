Modeling viral rebound in the next Berlin patient -- CONFIDENTIAL DURING REVIEW

This code uses a model by Conway et al. https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2020.1015 and others to calculate recrudescence rates for HIV rebound after analytical treatment interruption. The goal was to demonstrate that the prolonged remission in the new Berlin patient is highly unlikely to be natural and estimate reservoir reductions.
